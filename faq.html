          How does the account transfer process work?
        </h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Once you've inquired about an account and we've confirmed
            details, payment, and verified your information, we will
            initiate the secure account transfer. This typically involves
            providing you with the necessary login credentials and guiding
            you through changing the associated email, password, and
            security settings to your own. We prioritize your privacy and
            account security throughout this process.
